## Welcome to Luke's Connect 4 app built with React.js

This web application builds upon [this tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) by converting the tic-tac-toe game into connect 4. The components are also broken into their own files.

To see it in action, clone this repo, type `npm install` to import all dependencies, then type `npm run dev`. The product can be seen running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
